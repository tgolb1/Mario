Title: Not So Super Mario Bros


Information:
  This project creates a text-based simulation of the 
  popular Nintedo game, "Super Mario Bros."


Running the program:
  First create a .txt file with the specifications listed in Execution (below)
  To run the simulation, open terminal and do the following...
      1. Navigate to the directory containing the files
      2. Enter the following commands
            g++ *.cpp
            ./a.out
      4. Follow the prompts
      5. Check directory for the filename you provided as output

Execution:
  The program will prompt the user for the absolute path of a txt file (e.g. 'preferences.txt')
  containing the following information... (note lines 4-8 must add to 100)
      Line # 1 is the number of levels, L (a positive integer)
      Line # 2 is the dimension of the grid, N (a positive integer)
      Line # 3 is the number of initial lives, V (a positive integer)
      Line # 4 is the approximate percentage of the positions in each level with coins (a positive
      integer)
      Line # 5 is the approximate percentage of the positions in each level with nothing (a positive
      integer)
      Line # 6 is the approximate percentage of the positions in each level with Goombas (a positive
      integer)
      Line # 7 is the approximate percentage of the positions in each level with Koopas (a positive
      integer)
      Line # 8 is the approximate percentage of the positions in each level with mushrooms (a positive
      integer)

  The program will then prompt the user for a name for the output file (e.g. 'log.txt')

  The simulation will then read the input file, simulate gameplay, and output each step
  Mario takes in the output file.
